// Lesson Overview 
// Explain the three steps in the problem solving process
// Explain what pseudocode is and be able to use it to solve problems.
// Be able to break a problem down into subproblems.

// Understand the problem
//Fizz Buss
// Fizz with any number divisble by three
// Buss with any number divisble by five
// For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz
// Write a program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number
//between one and the number the user entered, Fizz (%3 ==0), Buzz (%5==0)
// FizzBuzz(%3==0 && %5==0)
